This year WiCS sponsored 12 girls to fly out to Houston, Texas for the annual [**Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing**][ghclink]! Many other WiCS members were also able to attend via other scholarships. In total, Columbia and Barnard were well represented with over 30 students attending!

It was a fantastic experience full of amazing panels, inspiring women, and the nerdiest and most progressive small talk you can imagine. 

Here's some comments from the girls who went: 

> The best parts of GHC were just the unorganized opportunities to meet other women in computer science - while waiting in line for a talk or coffee or eating lunch. I also enjoyed the career fair and some of the technical as well as career advice talks. Sheryl Sandberg is a great speaker! 
- __Diana Liskovich, Columbia College__


> I really enjoyed the Career panels. There's rarely an opportunity to talk to so many new grads and get their insights about transitioning to industry. GHC provided a safe space to talk about anything without the fear of being judged. 
- __Katie Lin, SEAS__

> GHC exposed me to a lot of incredible women. It changes what you think is possible...Some of the female engineers at the career fair were so open and encouraging. It was motivating because it made me think, "School's tough but these engineers are really smart and cool, and I have a chance to build things with them when I graduate."...At GHC, there was always a way to find a safe space.
- __Emily Chen, SEAS__

> I really enjoyed the approachability of the speakers. Generally, they were eager to answer additional questions after their formal session had ended. It was also amazing meeting women behind the latest technology (oculus VR, accessible design, etc.)
- __Monica Powell, Barnard College__

Thank you [**Anita Borg Institute**][anitaborglink] for organizing such an amazing event to encourage and inspire women in tech! See you next year!
