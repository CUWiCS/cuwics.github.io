![Google WiCS Symposium]({{ site.url }}/assets/blog2015/WiCS_Symposium.jpg)

Last Friday, WiCS attended the Symposium for Women in Computing at the Google NYC office. The goal of the symposium was 
to help address the challenges women in CS can expect to face in a predominantly male environment and it did just that! 
Female engineers and professors alike spoke in on how they felt about harrassment, work balance, and the typical problems
women will face while continuing in the computer science field. 

There were a lot of great tips and fabulous speakers, and the discussion continued from the moment we left the office to
the moment we got back to campus. We look forward to the conversations that'll spring from this, and hope more women
start thinking about their future in tech.
