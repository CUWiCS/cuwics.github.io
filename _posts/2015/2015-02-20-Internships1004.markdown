On Thursday, WiCS held a lively panel discussion about how students can find their first Computer Science-related internship, even if they don't have a lot of coding experience. The panelists -- Emily Pakulski (CC '16), Samara Trilling (CC '15), and Miles Milton (CC '17) -- discussed their experiences as first time interns both in research and in industry. Other topics included resources available to Columbia and Barnard students, job search, interview, and even negotiation advice.
