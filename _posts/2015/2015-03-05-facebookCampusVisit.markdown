Facebook came to campus recently to give WICS, Society of Women Engineers (SWE), Columbia Data Science Society (CDSS) and the rest of Columbia's student body a chance to engage with women on Facebook's tech teams. Two female software engineers, a female data scientist, a Software Engineering recruiter and a Data Science recruiter visited us to answer students' questions about the hiring process and what it's like to work at Facebook.

The night started with a discussion of Facebook's culture. The recruiters shared examples of fun perks, such as a spa where team members can get manicures and social groups for everyone from gamers to cyclers. Next came an interactive Q&A, where students learned about the onboarding process, tips for technical interviews and mobility within groups. Afterward, the recruiters reviewed resumes and students chatted one-on-one with the engineers about topics such as the stacks they use and the challenges involved in optimizing features like People search. There was a great turnout and the event was an opportunity to bring together the Columbia tech community, as well. WICS members were especially thrilled to meet an all-female panel and we want to give a huge thanks to Facebook for making it happen!
