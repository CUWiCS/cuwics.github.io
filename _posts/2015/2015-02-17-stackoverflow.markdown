On Friday, WICS visited [**StackExchange**][stackexchange]'s office, home of the StackOverflow community. We toured their office which has amazing views of NYC's bridges and even got a chance to eat in their in-house cafeteria with engineers! Afterwards, we had a Q&A session with devs Roberta and Anna. Roberta works remotely in Brazil, so we were able to get a sense of what collaboration is like when everyone is all over the world. 

Thanks for hosting us, Jon and StackExchange!
