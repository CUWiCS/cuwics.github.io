Thanks to everyone who came to our annual Spring Networking Dinner on Thursday, April 23rd! Check out more photos [here](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.977441082275557.1073741839.741854835834184). 

We had a completely full house with over 100 women in Computer Science joining us to hang out and eat delicious Italian food. 20-25% of attendees were engineers from companies and startups with local offices, with the remaining attendees being Columbia and Barnard students from all class levels. As we wrapped up, we handed out amazing swag bags with lots of cool tech gear.
