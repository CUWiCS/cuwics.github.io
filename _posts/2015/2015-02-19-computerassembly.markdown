![Build a PC]({{ site.url }}/assets/blog2015/compassembly.jpg)

Today WiCS joined with the Barnard College Information Technology department (BCIT) to hold one of our most looked forward to workshops of the semester - assembling and dissassembling a computer! 

The computers were generously donated by BCIT, to be picked and prodded over by all manner of curious students. Both computers were taken completely apart from CPU to video card, and unlike humpty dumpty, managed to make it back together again. And in perfect working order! 

Congratulations are deserved to everyone who turned out! And a just as big congrats to Michelle Navarro, who won the raffle for the Notable Women In Computer Science deck. She got the signed deck, a chocolate apple, and our eternal jealousy. (But don't worry. We'll have more decks soon!)

Thanks again to BCIT for hosting us as part of Love Your Computer Week, and of course, thanks to everyone that came!
