[**Segovia**][Segovia] is a small startup that builds enterprise software to fight extreme poverty. NGOs and governments often run anti-poverty programs without modern technology, leading to tremendous waste. Segovia's team builds tools to help them efficiently identify people in need and send them cash without fraud or delay. They invited WiCS to visit their office in WeWork Chelsea, where we had an opportunity to meet Satwik Seshasai, CTO, and Software Engineers Sid Nair and Charles Guo, two of their earliest hires.

We learned about what it's like to perform requirements gathering and product testing on the ground in parts of Africa; the challenges posed by the different infrastructure (i.e. banking, technology) that's in place where anti-poverty programs are deployed; and why each of the Segovia engineers enjoys working in their small, tight-knit team.

They even treated us to apple cider and snacks from the farmer's market! Thanks Segovia, for the opportunity to meet the team and learn about your mission.
