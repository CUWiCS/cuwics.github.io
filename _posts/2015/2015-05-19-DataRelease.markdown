This past semester, the Columbia CS department gave us some stats on how female students stack up in terms of enrollment in the department. We learned a lot about the **current state of our department**, but perhaps more importantly, about demographic shifts in the department over time. 

This is where we're at right now:

And this is how we stack up against the past:

For copies of the complete WiCS flyer, we have both [**color**][color_v] and [**black and white**][bw] versions.
