Last Friday, WiCS brought a group of, about 20 women, to Bloomberg's HQ in midtown Manhattan. The students who came ranged from freshman to senior, with backgrounds in Math, Psychology, and Computer Science. Our afternoon trip brought us to Bloomberg's well known transparent building for informal meet-and-greets with some of their current interns, as well as members of their newly created BWIT (women in technology) group, and a tour of their building. 

The current interns gave us insights into what their daily work-life was like at Bloomberg and showed us a demo of their projects. They also gave tips on what classes they were taking in school, how to prepare for interviews, and how they got their internship at Bloomberg. The Women in Technology group was an informal conversation about what it was like to be a woman in tech and how Bloomberg was cultivating such an environment. 

Thanks to our recruiter, Willow, who set up our visit to Bloomberg! 

See all of you guys at our next site visit!
