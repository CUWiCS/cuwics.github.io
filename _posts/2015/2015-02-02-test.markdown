WICS recently got to try some physical computing on campus when members of the Temboo team came and led a workshop for us. Temboo is a platform that allows users to program Arduino Yun devices to connect with web services. For instance, Temboo makes it easier to use sensor input to trigger events like posting a Twitter update, uploading a file to Dropbox or posting data to a Google spreadsheet. Each of these capabilities can be invoked by running a Temboo Choreo.
