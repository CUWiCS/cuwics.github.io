*Our panelists providing advice for the internship hunt.*

On Thursday, WiCS held a panel discussion geared towards students beginning their first Computer Science-related internship having only taken an introductory CS course.

Our panelists -- Alison Chang (CC '16), Anfal Boussayoud (BC '16), and  Cherie Luo (BC '17) -- all had different journeys in CS. They discussed their experiences with interning at a startup, interning at a large tech company, and even doing research!

Afterwards, an HR representative from Google provided advice about how to be a strong applicant and doing well in the interview process. 

Special thanks to our student panelists, Google for sending a representative and swag, and Yahoo for sponsoring refreshments! 

WiCS wishes you all the best of luck on your summer internship hunt!
