On October 19, Tumblr invited WiCS to tour their NYC offices. We had the opportunity to explore Tumblr headquarters starting from their decked out, newly renovated rooftop, to their fully stocked kitchen, all the way down to their open meeting area, where we later hosted a panel. The panel featured four inspiring women who work at Tumblr, on the engineering teams and in other non-tech divisions. The diversity of women on the panel helped the audience better understand the collaborative environment at Tumblr and how different teams can work together on projects. In addition, the panelists discussed their backgrounds and many of their non-conventional paths that eventually led them to work at Tumblr. As a whole, they encouraged students to take risks in college, to explore engaging classes that are interesting and thought provoking. The panel ended with a fifteen minute QA session where students had the chance to wrap up and ask any burning questions. Finally, the site visit ended with a dinner where students could further chat with the panelists over pizza! Thank you so much Tumblr, we had a great time and we loved learning more about your culture, projects, and internships!
