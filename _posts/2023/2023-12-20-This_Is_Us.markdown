Can you believe that Women in Computer Science have been around since 1998? And it’s because of this great community that we still are here. Meet our board members, the reason why they are here, advice to go navigate through school, and the best places in New York City:

### Rachel Chung, Co-President
Describe yourself in three words
- Honest, resourceful, optimistic

Why did you want to be part of WiCS?
- I attended some general body meetings freshman year and found that the meetings were low pressure and all the members were really chill. I was comfortable talking to everyone and wanted to be more involved in WiCS in another way.

How would you describe the energy of working and learning with women and gender-diverse people?
- I can tell that everyone who is committed to WiCS really cares for the club and our mission. I appreciate that I am able to surround myself with such dedicated and passionate people.

If you weren't here, where would you be?
- I can't imagine being anywhere else! I love being at Columba, in New York City, and in WiCS!

### Samantha Burak, Co-President:
Describe yourself in three words
- Hardworking, idealistic, empathetic

Why did you want to be part of WiCS?
- I applied for WiCS Board in my freshman year because I had been involved with a similar club at my high school, and I wanted to find the same community in college. The WiCS newsletter was also an invaluable resource for navigating class registration, internship finding, and more during my first year. I wanted to contribute to the club's initiatives of sharing knowledge and building friendships.

How would you describe the energy of working and learning with women and gender-diverse people?
- The energy is so positive and supportive. I love working with other WiCS members, because it's a fun and encouraging atmosphere that makes the whole experience enjoyable and rewarding. As an underclassman, I learned so much from the juniors and seniors in the club - it's been rewarding to be able to give back and continue the cycle of helping others succeed.

What's the best advice a professor has given you?
- Pay attention in class - based on the current price of tuition, each class period is worth a few hundred dollars.

If you weren't here, where would you be?
- I'd still be in New York, trying something music or dance related

### Alayna Nguyen, Vice President
Describe yourself in three words:
- Practical, persistent, pun-loving

Why did you want to be part of WiCS?
- I was searching for a space to connect with other like-minded female + non-binary students in CS. It was also a great opportunity to help organize DivHacks—hackathons played a big role in my decision to pursue CS and I wanted to share the experience with others.

How would you describe the energy of working and learning with women and gender-diverse people?
- It's a very uplifting experience—the focus in my discussions with others when planning events for WiCS are always to foster inclusivity and create CS opportunities/spaces that will connect students.

What's the best advice a professor has given you?
- My Algos professor, Yihao Zhang, taught me to focus on the joy of problem solving!

If you weren't here, where would you be?
- Studying at Hogwarts (potions would be interesting!)

- Xi'an Famous Foods (Shaanxi spicy cumin lamb noodles) on 78th—a quick walk away from the MET which makes it a perfect post-gallery touring meal

### Catherine Ji, Vice President
Describe yourself in three words:
- Optimistic, easy-going, creative

Why did you want to be part of WiCS?:
- I wanted to meet more women and gender-diverse people in CS while helping establish a supportive community. Back in high school, I enjoyed the experience of getting together and studying with friends, so I wanted to recreate that, especially given the isolating era of Zoom classes.

How would you describe the energy of working and learning with women and gender-diverse people?:
- I would say harmonious because everyone is so humble and willing to offer their insight, which is very encouraging when you are not feeling very confident about the material.

What's the best advice a professor has given you?:
- Just have fun. I had a lot of internal debate regarding whether I should go on to pursue a graduate degree right out of undergrad or go to industry directly, but Professor Plancher assured me that one's career and life path is never linear. The key is to do what you enjoy the most at the moment.

If you weren't here, where would you be?:
- In another life, I would be busy whipping up pastries in my own little bakery + cafe. But you never know, maybe that will be my life in 10 years.

### Indigo Parlin, Operations Chair
Describe yourself in three words:
>Outgoing, Creative, Genuine

Why did you want to be part of WiCS?
>I joined WiCS during covid because I didn't know much about CS opportunities as a FLI student who started college online. Once I joined I really liked the idea of helping other people in similar situations find opportunities in Computer Science.

How would you describe the energy of working and learning with women and gender-diverse people?
>I love the people I've worked with at WiCS. Everyone has their own unique personality and energy and we all support each other in what is a really hard major for most people.

What's the best advice a professor has given you?
>I TA for Adam Cannon, and he always gives the advice to relax and not stress so much about grades and jobs -- everything will work out. Even though I can't say I was always relaxed, he was right that everything will turn out okay.

If you weren't here, where would you be?
>Well, I won't be here for much longer because I'm going to do a study abroad term in Australia next semester! So let's just say somewhere warm!
