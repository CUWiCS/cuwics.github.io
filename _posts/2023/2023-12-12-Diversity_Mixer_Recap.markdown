With an entertaining Jeopardy Game on December 1st, we hosted a new NSBE x WiCS x ColorStack: Black and Latina Women in CS Mixer. The event was organized by the WiCS Diversity and Inclusion committee, consisting of Maiya Morgan (Barnard ‘25), Daniella Cardenas (SEAS' 26), Kristy Martinez (SEAS ‘26), and Christine Lam (Barnard ‘26), NSBE led by Mandy Jenkins (SEAS ‘24) and ColorStack, led by Michaela Gary (Barnard ‘25).

"This year, WiCS expanded our commitment to diversity by adding a committee specifically focused on diversity and inclusion efforts," says Samantha Burak (SEAS ‘24), WiCS Co-President. "Our mission has always been to foster an inclusive community that supports the advancement of underrepresented students in computer science. I'm glad we collaborated with NSBE and ColorStack to continue furthering that mission and host a successful event."

For the event, the Diversity and Inclusion committee lead Maiya Morgan was in charge of the questions included in the Jeopardy Game, and she says that "hosting events for Black and Latina women in computer science is vital because it offers a space to connect, feel supported, and break down barriers in an often underrepresented field. We hope to create a comfortable environment that makes everyone in the tech space feel welcome".

Thanks to everyone who participated and collaborated to create this great mixer.
