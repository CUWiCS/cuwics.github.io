Thanks everyone for coming to NetWiCS, our annual Spring Networking Dinner on Friday, April 22nd! We had the honor to have over 100 women in tech to join us at Diana Event Oval.

This year, 38 women engineers from companies and startups came to our event. The rest of attendees were students from Columbia and Barnard. After a warm opening, we had a great time talking to each other and enjoying delicious Pisticci food. Then we had a great speed-networking between engineers and students.
