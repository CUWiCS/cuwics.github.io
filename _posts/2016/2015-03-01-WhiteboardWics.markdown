WhiteBoard with WiCS was WiCS' first technical interview workshop, and it was a definite success! Prepped
with worksheets and whiteboards, the WiCS board led students through several questions and examples of 
technical interview questions. We alternated languages between C, Python, Java, or whatever was needed. 

Fun solutions were created, and good times were had!

WiCS wishes you all the best of luck on that internship hunt!
