Today WiCS joined with the Barnard College Information Technology department (BCIT) to hold one of our so-much-fun workshops - assembling and dissassembling a computer! The computers and food were generously donated by BCIT.  
  
We first went over a slide deck on the parts inside a PC.

Our event coordinators worked together with other girls to first open up the computer case, then disassemble each part, and finally piece them back. There were no extra parts left when we finished assembling them back! Yay :)

Thanks again to BCIT for hosting us as part of Love Your Computer Week, and of course, thanks to everyone that came!
