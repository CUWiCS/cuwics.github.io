On April 1st, a group of us went down to Watson's HQ on Manhattan. The
event drew enormous interest (with one of our longest waitlists ever),
so we hope to make another trip soon.

We had an awesome time at their beautiful office, and enjoyed chatting
with their engineers and having lunch. Thanks, Watson!
