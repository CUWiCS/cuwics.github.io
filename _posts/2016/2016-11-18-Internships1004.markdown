On November 18th, WICS had our annual internship information session, Internships 1004. We had four panelists: Melody Ju, Angel Maredia, 
Miles Hilton, and Emily Chen, who interned at Microsoft, Facebook, Goldman Sachs, and Meetup, respectively, with Cindy as moderator. 
Our panelists shared valuable insight about the application process, the interview process, the experience overall, and how their 
internships affected the decisions they made for the following summer.
