On November 16th, Two Sigma hosted an interview workshop in the CS Open Space. 
Students from all four undergraduate and the graduate schools came for presentation of all the tips and tricks for a successful interview. 
The Two Sigma engineers also graciously one-on-one looked over the resumes of students and gave critical feedback of how to improve it. 

Thank you again Two Sigma for taking your time out to come and spend it with us! We had great time!
