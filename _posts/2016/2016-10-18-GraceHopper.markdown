This year, 9 WiCS members attended Grace Hopper Convention 2016 in Houston, Texas. In this 3-day conference, they had an amazing time meeting various tech companies at the large company expo, attending tech talks, trying virtual reality, collecting TONS of swag, exploring uptown Houston, meeting other Columbia women in CS, and more!

A huge shout out to WiCS treasurer, Katie Lin, who coordinated the trip. We couldn't have had this trip without you. Thank you for all that you do!

And thank you to this year's corporate sponsors (Yahoo!, Bloomberg, CME Group, Oscar, Two Sigma, Microsoft, Google, Yelp, and Barnard College Provost Office)  who helped fund this awesome experience. 

"I've never been to an event like this before," said WiCS President Cherie Luo '17. "It was my first time at GHC and it was absolutely empowering to be surrounded by thousands of other women in tech. I loved meeting CS students from other universities and trying out new technologies I would never have had the chance to try otherwise!"
