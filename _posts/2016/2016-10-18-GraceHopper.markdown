This year 9 WiCS members flew to Houston, Texas at the end of October to attend Grace Hopper Convention 2016! In this jam-packed, activity-filled, 3-day conference, the students met various tech companies at the huge expo, attended inspiring tech talks that spanned from discussions about Internet of Things all the way to leadership and management, tried virtual reality, collected TONS of swag, explored uptown Houston, met other Columbia women in CS, and much more!

A huge shout out to WiCS treasurer, Katie Lin, who coordinated every aspect of the trip. Thank you for your time, dedication, and patience. We wouldn't have had this trip without you!

And thank you to this year's corporate sponsors (Yahoo!, Bloomberg, CME Group, Oscar, Two Sigma, Microsoft, Google, Yelp, and Barnard College Provost Office)  who helped fund this awesome experience. 

"I've never been to an event like this before," said WiCS President Cherie Luo '17. "It was my first time at GHC and it was absolutely empowering to be surrounded by thousands of other women in tech. I loved meeting CS students from other universities and trying out new technologies I would never have had the chance to try otherwise!"
