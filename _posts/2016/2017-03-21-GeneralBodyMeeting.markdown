On March 21st, WiCS held our first General Body meeting open to all students sharing our mission and values. The agenda started with a quick introduction of the current board members and a little info on what we all do. Students broke off into groups to discuss Susan Fowler’s Uber article. It was great to hear everyone’s opinions and listen to personal experiences. Afterwards, we all shared quick final thoughts, leaving the room open to questions about elections as well as general WiCS questions.
