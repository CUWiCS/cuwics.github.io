On Monday of the second week of school, WiCS held its welcome back event. We chatted about the new semester, what classes we anticipate the most, and more. 

Thanks everyone for coming to our first event of this semester! Welcome new students to Columbia and welcome back, returning students! Hope you all enjoyed the snacks and the pumpkin pie : )
