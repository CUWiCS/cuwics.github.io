On Nov 2, Zynga hosted a pottery painting night at Little Shop of Crafts on 94th and Amsterdam. WiCS members painted beautiful ceramic plates, mugs, piggy banks, and more while chatting with female engineers and a recruiter from Zynga. We learned so much about Zynga's culture, projects, and diversity. We had an amazing time and WiCS is so excited to have the opportunity to successfully plan a new type of info session.
