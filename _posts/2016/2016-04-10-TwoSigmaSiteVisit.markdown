Last Friday, WiCS went to hang out with some awesome female engineers from
Two Sigma. They talked at length about the technical problems they faced 
day-to-day (ranging from things like network failures to coming up with
concrete implementations for a theoretical math problem) as well as what
led them to Two Sigma. WiCS attendees then had the opportunity to chat with
Two Sigma employees (including recruiters) over burritos from Dos Toros.

If you're not familiar with Two Sigma, here's a little about them and what
they look for in people:
_"At Two Sigma we find connections in all the world’s data. These insights
guide investment strategies that support retirements, fund research, advance
education, and benefit philanthropic initiatives. So, if harnessing the power
of technology, mathematics, and data to help people is something that excites
you, let’s connect."_
