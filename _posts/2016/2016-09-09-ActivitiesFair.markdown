On Friday, WiCS tabled at Butler lawn for Activities Fair. It was a sunny afternoon, and we had BuzzFeed stickers and pens from our sponsors at our table. We introduced what WiCS does and what events we have for this semester.

Thanks everyone who stopped by our table and listened to us! We hope to see you again in our events.
