We had such an incredible time hacking with everyone at Divhacks 2019: Uplifting Urban America!! Participants heard from our keynote speaker, Maggie Chan Jones, the Founder and CEO of [Tenshey, Inc.][tenshey], a startup "dedicated to advancing gender diversity through executive coaching, one female leader at a time." Besides plenty of hacking, there were also workshops on HTML/CSS and Flask.

Thank you to everyone who came out, and we'll see you again next year!
