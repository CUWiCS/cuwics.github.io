This semester, WiCS has teamed up with the [Society for Women in Physics] and the [Association for Women in Math] for a weekly "Supper and Solve," where TAs can help students over free food! So far it's been a huge hit. Come every Monday night from 7-10 pm in Mathematics 508 whether you have questions or you're just hungry!
