After months of preparation, we were so happy to host Barnumbia students and engineers from GTS, SeatGeek, BBH, Dropbox, Google, HRT, Two Sigma, PDT Partners, Bloomberg, Spotify, Vimeo, and WeWork plus amazing professors and PhD candidates from right here at Columbia! Attendees networked with each other in six speed rounds over delicious Malaysian food from Laut. We had the best time expanding our networks both on and off campus with empowering women! Thank you to everyone who attended and/or helped out, especially our wonderful board, event coordinators, and graduating seniors.
