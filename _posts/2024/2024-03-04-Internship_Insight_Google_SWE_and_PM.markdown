When it comes to tech companies, few match the influence of Google. I talked with **Catherine Ji**, a senior at Barnard studying Computer Science, to hear about her experience as a Google intern. In the past two summers, she interned at Google as a Software Engineering (SWE) intern and as an Associate Product Manager (APM) intern.

**Q: Can you describe your typical day as a Google intern?**

**A:** My day typically started with a delicious breakfast at 9 AM. Afterwards, as a SWE intern, I would jump into my work and start writing code. Occasionally, I would participate in a meeting with coworkers or the manager to solve a bug, but most of the time, I would simply walk up to their desks for a quick chat. After lunch at noon, I typically had some more time to work alone before heading into my team's stand-up meetings to report on my progress and hear about my teammates' updates.

As an APM, I typically start the day by going through all my emails and direct messages to see if there's anything urgent that requires my attention. After that, my time is split between meetings with different members of the team (e.g., engineers, UX designers, business partners, legal, other PMs, etc.) and writing documents that define product requirements based on collected feedback and discussions.

**Q: What are some differences between being a SWE vs an APM intern?**

**A:** SWE work is much more independent, so SWE might be more suitable if you are someone who enjoys being able to focus and solve problems on your own. On the other hand, APM (and PM in general) is more collaborative and involves a lot of talking and working with others to get the widest range of perspectives.

**Q: What was your favorite part about being a Google intern?**

**A:** My favorite part of being a Google intern (aside from all the free food and snacks) is the community aspect. The company puts a lot of effort into creating opportunities for interns to meet and have fun together, so my summers felt like an extension of college, with things like social lunches and off-site activities.

**Q: Can you describe the application process?**

**A:** The process for both roles starts with the online application, where you provide your resume and basic information. For SWE, you then complete an online assessment of your technical skills and a series of technical interviews. For APM, the interview process consists of a written assignment and a series of PM-style interviews.

**Q: What do you think helped you the most with getting your internships?**

**A:** Aside from finalizing your resume with relevant experiences that highlight your technical and leadership skills, I found that practicing interview problems through Leetcode and watching YouTube videos on PM interviews helped me go into the interviews more confident, organized, and composed.

**Q: Do you have any tips for people hoping to get an internship at Google (or an internship in general)?**

**A:** A lot of the time, solving the problem isn't the most important part; what matters is how you approach the problem and how well you can convey your thought process to your interviewer!
