Today, the Halite team from Two Sigma shared their project with us! Almost ten company members joined us in talking about their jobs and in giving us a look into the company dynamic. They talked about their roles, the challenges, the diversity, the goods, and what can be improved, which lead to a very thoughtful and real conversation between the members and the students. Then, they dove right in to their side project, Halite! They gave us a demo, and encouraged us to create our own bot. They have starting code that new users can play around with and to be introduced to the game. Give it a try! (It may even help you get an interview at Two Sigma!)

Halite is a TS-built open source competition; it’s a fun, territorial, bot-building AI/programming game with a dynamic leaderboard populated by ever-grasping bots battling to the top. It has essentially no relation to our business, but it gives players a glance into one of our collective extracurricular time-eaters.

Thank you Two Sigma for sharing Halite with us and for giving us an insight into the company! Without a doubt, many students will get hooked on this AI game! (Thank you for the delicious food too!)
