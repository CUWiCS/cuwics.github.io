For those interested in learning more about product + strategy in the startup world, we held an event with Bumble to introduce our WICS community members to the field. Andee Olson, the Director of Content Strategy at Bumble, came to speak about her role at Bumble and her journey to where she is today. Bumble is a female-focused dating app founded in December of 2014 that has headquarters in Austin and offices all around the world. The app has three verticals: Bumble for dating, Bumble BFF for finding friends, and Bumble Bizz for networking. Thank you Ms. Olson for sharing your experiences and stories with our members, and thank you to Bumble for the delicious food too!
