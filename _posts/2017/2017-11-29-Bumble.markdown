For those interested in learning more about product + strategy in the startup world, we held an event with Bumble to introduce our WICS community members to the field. Andee Olson, the Director of Content Strategy at Bumble, came to speak about her role at Bumble and her journey to where she is today. She detailed her path to Bumble along with all the obstacles she faced, sharing how taking risks pay off. She talked about how her background in engineering defined and shaped the way she thinks about a problem and how she goes about solving them. Afterwards, she discussed the issues women face in tech today and how Bumble has created such a supportive environment to empower women. Bumble is a female-focused dating app founded in December of 2014 that has headquarters in Austin and offices all around the world. The app has three verticals: Bumble for dating, Bumble BFF for finding friends, and Bumble Bizz for networking. Thank you Ms. Olson for sharing your experiences and stories with our members, and thank you to Bumble for the delicious food too!
