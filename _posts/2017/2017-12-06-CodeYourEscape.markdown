We all love Escape the Rooms. Well, this Wednesday, Goldman Sachs brought our community challenging technical problems to solve together to code their escape! This past-paced, interactive game was a wonderful way for students to work together, as well as for Goldman Sachs to recruit for summer 2018. 

Thank you Goldman Sachs for coming and setting up this fun environment for our community members!
