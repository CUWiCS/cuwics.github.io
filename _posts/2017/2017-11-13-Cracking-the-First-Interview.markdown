For our November General Body Meeting, we held a workshop on "cracking that first interview." While technical interviews are incredibly important, don't underestimate the impact more personal questions can have. "Tell me about yourself or tell us about a time you worked in a group or what is your greatest weakness...questions like these can be tricky especially at your first couple of interviews. At the workshop, we focused on providing community members with the information and practice they need to ace their introductions. With ample preparation, we are confident you'll be ready for your interviews. Good luck and be confident!
