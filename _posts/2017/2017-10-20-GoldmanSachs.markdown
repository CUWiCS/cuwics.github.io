On Friday, October 20, we took WICS Community members down to Goldman Sachs in Tribeca for a meetup with the women in technology. We first  heard from a speaker, a huge advocate for women in STEM fields. She told us about the importance of women in these tech roles, the challenges women face, and what it's like to work in tech at Goldman Sachs. She was enthusiastic, warm, and encouraging. We then were given a tour of the different trade floors and learned more about what happens in each sector. After the tour, Goldman Sachs put on a panel of four women to speak about their experiences and their roles in the company. They spoke a little about their backgrounds and how they got to where they are today. A few were even Columbia/Barnard graduates! They then provided us with delicious food and desserts to munch on while chatting with the recruiters and women engineers. It was definitely an exciting and welcoming event, so thank you Goldman Sachs for having us, for the inspiring talks, and for creating such an amazing, informative event! (not to mention the great food and fun swag!)
