Hi everyone! Thank you all for coming out to the activities fair last Friday and stopping by our booth. We were so happy to see so many ladies interested in Computer Science, and we had a wonderful time chatting with each and every one of you! If you haven't done so yet, sign up for our newsletter [**here**][mailinglist] and like us on [**facebook**][facebook] to stay informed about our upcoming events.

Don't worry if you couldn't make it to the fair last week! We will be having our first general body meeting on September 19 at 5:30pm in Lerner 569. Come to learn more about how you can get involved in the cs community. Hope to see you there!

Thanks to everyone who came! We canâ€™t wait for our next general body meeting!
