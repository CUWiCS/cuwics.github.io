While women nationally represent fewer than 20% of computer science majors, Columbiaâ€™s relatively high percentage of women CS majors in the 2016-2017 academic year ranks it among the top US universities in attracting women to computer science.

What accounts for Columbia's success? What does it feel like to be part of the 45%? What challenges remain? To address these questions, WICS held a panel with inspiring female role models at Columbia University to share their experiences and explore these questions.
We had student presentations, breakout discussions for brainstorming questions, and a panel discussion that included Julia Hirschberg, Kathy McKeown, Tal Malkin, and Lydia Chilton, who helped offer insights and advice for future direction.
