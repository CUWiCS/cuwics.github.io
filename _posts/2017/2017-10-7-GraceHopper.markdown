This past weekend, WICS sponsored ladies from Columbia to attend the Grace Hopper Celebration in Florida! This event is especially geared towards women, to encourage them to pursue STEM fields, like computer science. At the convention, students heard from inspiring keynote speakers, such as Fei-fei Li and Melinda Gates, in all topics, from Artificial intelligence, to Security and Privacy. There were also many presentations & workshops about the latest research, mentoring on pursuing a career in computer science, career fairs for students to learn about the exciting companies, and interviews for summer internships and jobs. Every day was filled with events like "Coffee and Crepes with Stripe" under the Orlando Eye, Google X's presentation on the Moonshot Project, and even Student Research Competitions. 

After the conference, our WICS members also went to Universal Studios and Harry Potter World! Check out our facebook page for more photos and fun.
