Imposter Syndrome affects everyone, especially as we launch ourselves into new settings, whether it be college or a new job. But, imposter syndrome is all in our heads. Feeling like we don't deserve what we have achieved or that we really don't know enough can be detrimental to our aspirations and health. On October 5, women from Google came to Columbia to discuss imposter syndrome and how to combat it.
They detailed how to recognize signs of imposter syndrome, the effects of it, shared personal stories in and out of the workplace setting, and showed the audience little exercises to feel more comfortable and confident. Sometimes just a power pose can help give us a little boost. So, strike the "Wonder Woman" hands on your hips pose and remember you deserve everything you earned! You are not a fraud.

Thank you Google for your insight and kind advice about imposter syndrome (as well as the tasty food)!
