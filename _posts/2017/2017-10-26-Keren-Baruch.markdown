This week, we had guest speaker Keren Baruch, an alum from Barnard College, speak about her job as a Senior Project Manager at LinkedIn, providing students with a look into project management, a new perspective on the PM mindset, and advice for approaching product challenges. She is an advocate for equal opportunity, making it her personal mission to provide access to opportunity at scale through data and technology. Students also got the change to learn a little more about LinkedIn. The event was informative and inspiring.

Thank you Ms. Baruch for taking time to share your experiences and expertise with us!
