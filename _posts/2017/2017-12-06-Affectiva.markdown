AI is all the rage today, and for good reason too! Affectiva is using artificial intelligence to recognize human emotions. Today,
Taniya Mishra, the lead Speech Scientist at Affectiva came to Columbia to give a tech talk on her work. She presented what emotion AI is, the applications, and the process of developing as well as some algorithms she uses to estimate emotions.

Title: Enabling Connections in a Hyperconnected World through Emotion AI

Abstract: 
We live in a hyperconnected world powered by smart devices. A big part of building connections is recognizing and responding to emotions. But our smart devices still lack this fundamental aspect of social communication, rendering our interactions with or through them superficial and limited. Now imagine if we could empower our devices with intelligence to recognize human emotions. The results would be transformative, ranging from empathetic chatbots to personalized digital signage to smart cars that ensure the comfort and safety of passengers by recognizing their emotions. Emotion AI — emotion estimation via artificial intelligence — can make this possible.

Affectiva is an emotion measurement technology - from MIT Media's Lab - which has developed a way for computers to recognize human emotions based on facial cues or physiological responses. Among the commercial applications, this emotion recognition technology is used to help brands improve their advertising and marketing messages. Another major application of Affectiva has been in political polling.
