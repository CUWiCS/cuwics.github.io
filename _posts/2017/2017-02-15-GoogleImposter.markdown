On February 15, WiCS and Google collaborated to present an intimate discussion about Imposter Syndrome for the CS community at Columbia.
Several Columbia alumni returned to campus to give an informal presentation about their imposter syndrome experiences at school and at Google.
It was incredibly informative and motivating to hear former students, and now successful software engineers, speak about ways they felt that 
they didn't belong - imposter syndrome affects a wide range of people and can definitely be overcome.
Afterward the presentation, they took questions from the crowd and handed out Google swag to the attendees!
