Welcome to WICS! On Tuesday, we held our first general body meeting of the year! We were so excited to see so many new faces. After some mingling, a couple cookies and grapes, we introduced the WICS board, upcoming events, and what our mission is, to advocate and encourage women to pursue computer science.

Then, we broke off into ice breakers where we played Heads Up with tech company names and into excited conversations among the general body members. It was wonderful getting to know all of you a little more!

After quick intros to our interests, students were then able to go up to the WICS E-board members to learn more about a specific field and about our experiences we had in classes or internships. We had representatives for anything from intelligence systems, to project managing, or even hardware! 

If you missed our general body meeting, stay tuned for our upcoming meetings and events in the future!
