We had our very last general body meeting of 2017 today to celebrate and wrap up a wonderful 2017! With tasty cookies and refreshments, our members relaxed and chatted with each other. Taking a break from studying to see our community members was refreshing and fun. We hope to see you next year! Remember, you are wonderful and deserve everything you accomplished! Good luck with finals! <3
