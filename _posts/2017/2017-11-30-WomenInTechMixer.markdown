With the hectic finals season about to begin, WICS, SWE, and ADI held a Women in Tech Mixer/Pajama Party to meet and hang out with fellow females in tech and engineering. Our members chatted about everything from learning how to become a TA, to some of the conferences out there, such as the Grace Hopper Conference or SWE Conference, while sipping on hot cocoa and munching on cookies. Attendees also decorated mugs and chilled with friends. Good luck with finals everyone! You got this!
