At the Women in Tech Mixer this past Monday, our very own Angel Maredia spoke as a panelist, along with three other women in tech!

From their different backgrounds and experiences, these inspiring students discussed some of the most significant challenges women face in the tech world today, notable experiences at Columbia, and their most memorable moment in their careers so far.  For Angel, one of her most memorable moments was at her internship this past summer where she and her team worked to make a product more accessible to the cognitively impaired users. Seeing the prototype being used, she felt like all the hours spent on the project were worth it because she was helping to improve other people's lives. 

After the panel, the conversations opened up. People were free to mingle or lemonade and cookies, chat, and ask the panelists questions.
Keep up with what the amazing women on campus are doing!
