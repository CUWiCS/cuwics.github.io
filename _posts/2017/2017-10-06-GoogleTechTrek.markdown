WICS community members spent the Friday hanging out with Google Engineers at the Google Tech Trek. To begin the day, they headed to Chelsea Market, and then met up with Columbia alums who now work as software engineers. They guided the students through mock phone and coding interviews, going over questions and giving advice, and then had the students practiced in pairs, interviewing each other.
After the mock interviews, the alums spoke on a panel about what they do, what teams they work on, what their days are like, and advice for aspiring engineers. After some questions and answers, the students were given a tour of Google Headquarters to finish off the event!

Thank you Google for hosting us and for the advice for our WICS members!
