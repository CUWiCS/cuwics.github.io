This Friday, we took our WICS community members down to the Facebook office! There, facebook engineers held a panel for us, sharing their roles and experiences, the community vibe, and about the internship programs they have for aspiring Facebook engineers. After the panel, we were given a brief tour of the office. Thank you Facebook for having us over!
