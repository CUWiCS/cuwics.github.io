This Friday, WICS collaborated with Lean In, an incredible organization on campus aimed at promoting the success for women in the workplace. This event featured early-in-career women at Microsoft who gave inspiring TED-esque talks to a roomful of ladies aspiring to be like them. They each spoke on their experiences and gave advice for us, told personal stories, and encouraged us to find a community and mentor to learn from and support each other. Following the talks, we had a Q&A panel where students could ask anything from the challenges they face to how they are overcoming them.  Thank you for coming to support these amazing women, and thank you Microsoft for sharing your stories this evening over dinner!

For those interested in Lean in, they have a great [**mentorship program**][leanIn]! And for those ladies who love computer science, come to more WICS events to be a part of the Women in Computer Science Community!
