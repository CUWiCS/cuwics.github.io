Today, BCIT and WICS hosted Computers, Assemble!/ Break Room! Where students got to take apart a computer while eating tasty food. This fun little event was put on to de-stress and hopefully answered some burning questions you may have had about what the inside of a computer looks like!

Students took a break from studying for midterms, chilling, playing video games, and chatting with each other over pizza. Thanks for joining us! Good luck on midterms and check out our upcoming events!
