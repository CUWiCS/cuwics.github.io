On Nov 12th, Women TechMakers (WTM) scholars paid us a visit to tell us all about the WTM program. Students grabbed some free swag and learned about the application process, open to both undergrad and graduate students. One WTM scholar in particular, Arunima Sharma, introduced a new student organization: Product Managers' Club at Columbia (PMC). Thank you to all the scholars for teaching us about WTM!
