Last Friday, we held our very first Track Expo for students to learn from each other about CS tracks and electives before course registration. We got the ball rolling with our "speed-dating" activity, where attendees were paired up for two minutes at a time to discuss an aspect of their academic CS experience, from their favorite classes to their biggest challenges. Then we held break-out sessions into tracks, with each track represented by older students who could give advice from their personal experience in the track. Students seeking advice could get to know these peer mentors in the tracks that they were considering. Our attendees left more clear-eyed, determined, and connected to one another, and we were thrilled by what everyone got out of the event. We hope to present many more academic events of the sort, so stay tuned!
