This past Thursday, women from Goldman Sachs came to talk about their experiences as a female engineer in the company, answering questions from where they got started and how they ended up where they are today, to the 'typical' day at Goldman Sachs. They spoke of the wonderful mentoring and supportive communities they are able to find in such a large company, as well as the incredible opportunities they have to work with teams across the world. They also shared the role of the intern in the work place and current opportunites! Don't forget to apply to Engineering Essentials!

Thank you Goldman Sachs for sharing your experiences and inspiring so many young women! The food was delicious as well!
