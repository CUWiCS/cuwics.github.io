At a competitive school like Columbia, filled with accomplished students, it can be easy to develop imposter syndrome. Luckily, Meghan Duffy, career coach and former Program Manager for the Grace Hopper Program gifted us with an imposter syndrome workshop and how to overcome imposter syndrome. 

The workshop defined imposter syndrome and its symptoms, and provided students with tips, examples, and exercises to combat the symptoms. We also discussed how imposter syndrome affects job searching, and ways to improve the job search process in general. 

Meg Duffy is a career coach who helps people launch and grow careers in tech. Over the course of her career, she’s worked as a camp counselor in Turkey, a track coach, an ESL tutor, an archivist for the Metropolitan Opera, the Chief of Staff at a tech startup, and the Program Manager of the Grace Hopper Program. These roles may seem varied, but they share a common thread. In each role, Meg provided structure, critical feedback, and emotional support to people pursuing their goals. As Program Manager, she found that the best part of her job was helping students through the job search process. Watching so many of her colleagues and students take bold risks inspired her to make the leap into coaching full-time. When she’s not coaching, you’ll find her running around Brooklyn, testing out new cheese-forward recipes, and following corgis on Instagram. You can learn more about her work at www.megduffy.com
