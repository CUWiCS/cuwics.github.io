On November 7th, Oscar Health invited us to learn from different individuals across the company and their roles in front-end engineering, back-end engineering, infrastructure/security engineering, product design, product management, and data science. The event began with a panel of representatives from each area, followed by smaller mentoring roundtables where attendees could speak personally with employees. 

Oscar is currently hiring in all of the above areas! Check out the open roles on the [**Oscar career website**][website].
