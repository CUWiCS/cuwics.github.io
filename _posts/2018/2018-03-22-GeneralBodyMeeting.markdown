Our March General Body Meeting was held on Thursday in Lerner 568. As people gathered into the room, we all wrote down one thing that we were scared about and one thing that we accomplished. Each note was folded up and put into a cup. As we sat around in a circle to talk about self-love, self-care and self-management, each person was able to take an anonymous note from the fear cup and read it out loud. Passing this around the circle, one thing that was noticed was that a lot of people had the same worries and fears. This reinforces the fact that you're not alone in the CS world at Columbia! The next round of the circle talked about people's accomplishments this year. So proud of everyone for making it through this long and cold semester. We hope to see you all at next month's general body meeting!
