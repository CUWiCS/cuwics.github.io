On September 19th, WiCS welcomed a panel of women from Facebook's Data Science and Data Engineering teams. Students enjoyed dinner while listening to our guests discuss a day in their lives, why they chose to pursue a career in data, and advice for students interested in data themselves. After the panel, students broke off into groups for networking.
