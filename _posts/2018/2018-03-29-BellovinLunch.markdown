Last Thursday, WiCS hosted a lunch with Professor Bellovin for students interested in Computer Science to discuss security and policy in tech. While delicious pizza and salad is always a treat, the lunch was truly an enjoyable learning experience. Professor Bellovin is currently involved with research on networks, security, privacy and related legal and policy issues. He received his BA degree from Columbia University, and previously served as Chief Technologist of the Federal Trade Commission. Prior to joining Columbia Faculty, he worked at the AT&T Lab.

During the lunch, he explained the story behind his publication, Firewalls and internet security: Repelling the wily hacker, which was a pioneering book about Internet Security at the time it was first published. We also discussed current controversies revolving security, such as location tracking court cases as well as the infamous Cambridge Analytica scandal. In response, Columbia students asked some intriguing questions regarding the ethical implications of internet privacy in our daily lives.
