This past Tuesday we had a panel discussion with women data engineers and data scientists to learn more about what they do, the difference between data engineering and data science, and whether the industry might be a good fit for some. The panelists included: Lory Nunez, Kyungeun Lim, Pamelu Wu, and Maureen Teyssier. This panel discussion was followed by a short introduction to Insight and a Q&A session.

Insight runs tuition-free fellowships for programmers, graduating students, PhDs, and postdocs looking to transition to careers in data engineering, data science, and artificial intelligence. Over the past 5 years, they have helped more than 1200 Insight Fellows become data engineers, data scientists, and artificial intelligence professionals at over 250 leading data-driven companies.

Thank you Insight Data Science for sharing your experiences and inspiring so many young women!
