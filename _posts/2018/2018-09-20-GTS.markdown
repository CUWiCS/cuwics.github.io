On September 17, GTS came to Columbia for an info session about its history and culture, as well as the types of technical problems the team tackles. Students enjoyed pizza and learned how to apply for an exclusive tour at the New York Stock Exchange.

Be on the lookout for more exciting info sessions in the future!
