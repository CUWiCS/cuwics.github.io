We at WiCS understand that there is always room for improvement when it comes to our resumés! In order to keep them polished, we invited recruiters from Palantir to lead a resumé-building workshop. Students received feedback from both the recruiters and their peers on how to best showcase their skills on paper. Attendees also left with a handout for reference in order to update their resumé or facilitate their own interactive peer feedback sessions on campus. We also enjoyed dinner from Thai Market and some free Palantir swag!

Thank you for the help, Palantir!
