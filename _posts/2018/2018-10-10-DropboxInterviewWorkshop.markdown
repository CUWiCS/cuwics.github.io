For many Computer Science students, technical interviews are a source of anxiety and stress. On October 2nd, Dropbox sought to help alleviate those feelings for students by hosting its very own interview workshop! The workshop was led by experienced engineers, and dinner from Dig Inn was provided. Students even got to take home some free swag ;)
