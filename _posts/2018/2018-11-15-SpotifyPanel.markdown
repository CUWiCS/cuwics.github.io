On the 15th, WiCS welcomed four talented panelists from Spotify to teach women and non-binary students about Spotify internships and culture. 

Students were walked through a brief overview of the Spotify internship program (which recent grads are also welcome to apply to!). Spotify offers both technical and non-technical internships, located in both Boston and NYC. Full information can be found here: www.Spotifyjobs.com/students 

After learning about the internship program, panelists answered questions regarding culture, diversity, and career advice. Afterwards, the floor was opened up to Q&A, both for the panel and other Spotify employees in attendance. Last but not least, students enjoyed plenty of free Spotify swag and fresh Insomnia cookies. 

Thanks to all the Spotify employees who braved the first snow of the season to be with us!
