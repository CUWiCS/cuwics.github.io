On Friday, Blackstone entertained students with its very own technology trivia night! Students enjoyed dinner from JunZi Kitchen and learning about Blackstone engineers' tech stacks.

Our own WiCS members Susie and Yuxuan did so well at the trivia night, they won Echo Dots! Congratulations, you two :)
