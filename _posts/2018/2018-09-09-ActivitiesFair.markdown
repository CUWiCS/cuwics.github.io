Hi everyone! Thank you all for coming out to the activities fair on Friday and stopping by our booth. We were so happy to see so many womxn interested in Computer Science, and we had a wonderful time chatting with each and every one of you!

Don't worry if you couldn't make it to the fair! We will be having our first general body meeting on September 17 at 8pm in the CS Lounge. Come to learn more about how you can get involved in the CS community, receive mentorship, and expand your career and education opportunities. We'll see you there!
