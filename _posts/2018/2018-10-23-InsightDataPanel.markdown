Last week, WiCS welcomed three talented women in data to speak about their careers as data scientists and data engineers. The panel featured Hoa Nguyen, Natalie Lebedeva, and Sara Rasmussen. Nguyen, Insight's head of data engineering, kicked off the event with a brief overview of various fellowship programs, including the Insight Data Science Fellowship. Lebedeva and Rasmussmen shared projects they worked on while at Insight to give students an idea of what kind of work awaits them in the field of data science and engineering. Lastly, there was a Q&A session for any additional topics students wanted to ask about.
