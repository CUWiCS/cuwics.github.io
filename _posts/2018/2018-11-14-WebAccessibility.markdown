On Nov 14, The Athena Digital Design Agency joined forces with WiCS to deliver students with a workshop on how to create accessible websites! Accessibility is often an overlooked but crucial feature of technology; after all, what good is any technology that isn't actually accessibile to a wide audience? Emphasis on effective accessibility is a large part of user experience design and part of what separates a good from a great product. 

Our introductory workshop taught students the basic tools needed for developing accessibility. Attendees learned how to evaluate the accessibility of their websites and the various technologies users employ to interact with the web. 

Thanks for teaming up with us, ADDA!
