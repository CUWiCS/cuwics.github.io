On Tuesday night, we hosted NetWICS 2018, our annual networking dinner to celebrate womxn in computer science! We expanded our event greatly from last year. We had 46 womxn engineers in attendance, representing: Accenture, Blackstone, Bloomberg, Brown Brothers Harriman, CME, Enigma, Frame.io, Google, Hudson River Trading, IBM, ITG, Meetup, MongoDB, Oscar Health, Percolate, Temboo, and Two Sigma. We also had 66 students from all undergraduate years, masters, and PhD attend the event. This is almost 20% larger than our capacity last year.

After signing in, attendees were directed to one of twelve tables to mingle with other students as well as professionals at each table. Our WiCS President, Julia, gave a quick introduction of our organization and the agenda, and with that the dinner began!

Students and engineers chatted over delicious food Laut, which is the first Malaysian restaurant in NYC to receive a Michelin star. Afterwards, we had engineers move to an assigned company table and held a speed networking breakout session. Every eight minutes, students would rotate between different tables to network with all the companies present.

To end the night, we served Insomnia cookies and cupcakes for dessert, and each attendee received a goodie bag of free tech swag from our sponsors.

Thank you to our wonderful engineers and attendees, as well as our sponsors and board members for making NetWics a success!
