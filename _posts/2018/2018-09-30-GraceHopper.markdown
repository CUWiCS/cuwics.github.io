Last week, WiCS sponsored several of its womxn to attend the 2018 Grace Hopper Conference in Texas! This 3-day long event is especially geared towards women to encourage them to pursue STEM fields, such as computer science. It offers students a multitude of learning opportunities and chances to discuss research and career interests.

At this year's Grace Hopper Conference, students attended the career fair Expo, heard from inspiring keynote speakers, and learned from a variety of track sessions, covering topics ranging from Artificial Intelligence, to a new track session called Tech for Women. Students were also encouraged to attend Mentoring Circles, where they could choose to chat with different mentors on interview tips, job searching, and general career advice. More details about the jam-packed schedule can be found [**here**][schedule]. Finally, the event closed with an evening celebration where students could kick back and let loose on the dance floor.
