At our last general body meeting, we all gathered into a circle to open up the floor to our members. Looking for possible event ideas as well as how WiCS can better serve the CS community, the group came up with a few ideas on events for the current and upcoming semester. The group also talked about diversity and inclusion in the cs community moderated by one of our community chairs. Several questions such as: Is the Columbia CS community supportive of women? How can WiCS better serve the CS community? were brought up. If you have any thoughts on these issues, donâ€™t hesitate to bring it up in our next general body meeting coming up on March 22nd!
